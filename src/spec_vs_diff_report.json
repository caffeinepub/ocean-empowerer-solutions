  "summary": "Diff implements a construction-themed single-page layout with updated header/footer navigation, SEO metadata, and backend inquiry/admin gating, but it also introduces unrequested backend user-profile features and does not provide clear diff evidence that the Contact form frontend was updated to match the new backend inquiry API and required validation/success behaviors.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Keep the existing inquiry submission flow functional end-to-end: the Contact form must submit name, email, phone, selected service type, and message to the Motoko backend and show clear success/error states in English.",
      "reason": "The backend submitInquiry signature now requires (name, email, phone, service, message), but the diff summary does not show any corresponding modifications to the frontend Contact form component and its backend mutation hook to send the new fields and implement inline validation + success/reset behavior; only backend/main.mo and navigation/SEO-related frontend files are shown as modified.",

      "reason": "While header/favicon/social images are clearly wired to generated assets, the diff summary does not provide direct evidence that the required section texture asset (construction-section-texture.dim_2400x1200.png) is actually referenced/used anywhere (only general styling/\"texture background helper\" is mentioned).",
