  "summary": "Most requested layout and styling changes are implemented: desktop header nav is right-aligned with larger link-style items, smooth scrolling is preserved, and active-section highlighting is added via an IntersectionObserver hook. Sections (Home/About/Services/Contact) and global styling were significantly enhanced with a cohesive theme. However, several additional unrelated changes (SEO/runtime hooks, deployment docs, placeholder query hooks) appear beyond the BuildRequest.",
