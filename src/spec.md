# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the single-page website’s overall visual polish and make the desktop header navigation right-aligned, larger, and clearly link-styled with scroll-based active states.

**Planned changes:**
- Update desktop header layout so the Home/About/Services/Contact navigation sits on the top-right (to the right of the logo) without overlapping, and increase link text size from the current small styling.
- Restyle header navigation into “link mode” (non-button appearance) with clear hover treatment and an active/selected indicator.
- Add scroll-spy behavior so the active nav link updates as the user scrolls through `home`, `about`, `services`, and `contact` sections (smooth-scroll on click remains).
- Enhance visual hierarchy and section presentation (spacing, typography rhythm, separators/background treatments, more polished section/card composition) while keeping the same single-page structure and section IDs.
- Apply and enforce a cohesive theme across header, sections, and footer (consistent colors, typography scale, spacing, and accents).

**User-visible outcome:** On desktop, users see a larger, right-aligned header menu that behaves like standard navigation links with hover and active states that update while scrolling; the Home/About/Services/Contact sections look more refined and consistent while remaining fully responsive.
