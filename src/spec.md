# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the ocean-themed brand logo to better communicate empowerment, upward growth, and confident market leadership while keeping a premium/clean look, and apply it consistently across the site and SEO metadata.

**Planned changes:**
- Create updated ocean-themed logo assets (horizontal lockup and square icon) with a clear upward/leadership cue while remaining minimal and readable at small sizes.
- Add the new generated logo assets to `frontend/public/assets/generated`.
- Update header and footer to reference the new horizontal empowerment logo asset instead of the current `premium-logo-horizontal.dim_512x128.png`.
- Update SEO/logo metadata to use the new logo/social image asset (Organization structured data logo, `og:image`, and `twitter:image`).

**User-visible outcome:** The site shows the new empowerment-focused ocean logo in the header and footer, and shared links/metadata use the updated logo image without broken asset links.
