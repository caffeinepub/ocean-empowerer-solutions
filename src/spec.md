# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Upgrade the site’s visual design to a cohesive, modern corporate/professional theme while keeping all existing sections and content structure unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Refine global theme tokens and base styles (colors, typography, spacing, borders, radii, shadows) to improve consistency, contrast, and readability.
- Standardize shared styling patterns (e.g., section spacing, headings, navigation link styles) to reduce one-off visual drift across sections.
- Polish key UI components (header/navigation, buttons, cards/panels in Services/Projects/Why Choose Us/About/Leadership/Contact) with consistent hover/focus states and responsive behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** The site looks consistently more polished and corporate across all pages/sections, with improved readability and more consistent component styling (including in light/dark mode where supported), without any content or feature changes.
